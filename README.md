[![Python Version](https://img.shields.io/pypi/pyversions/library2notion.svg)](https://pypi.org/project/library2notion/)

A tool to create a library on Notion with all your books (digital or not) in order to make it easier to find them, add comments, priorities, filter by type or category and keep track of read ones.

Main features:
- Detects all digital books from a given path and all the subfolders.
- Adds, updates or deletes entries on Notion DB to match the status of the local folder.
- Possibility to create a simple .paper file to add non-digital to be tracked as well.
- Extracts metadata from .pdf and .epub files.

## Input

### -p, --Path

The path where to look for files (and subfolders). It is higly recommended to use relative paths. This is really important since it will also be used to generate the tags of each book. (Take a look at "Metadata" section for further info).

For example, if your library looks like:
```plain
/home/your_user/Documents/books/Programming/Python
/home/your_user/Documents/books/Programming/C
/home/your_user/Documents/books/History/Spanish History
```
They ideal way to proceed is, first, move to `books` folder, since it is the common one for all books.
```plain
cd /home/your_user/Documents/books
```
And from here, execute l2n with a relative path:
```plain
library2notion -p "./"
```
They way a book is uniquely identified is by using its path. This is important because the book `./books/Programming/Python/PythonCookbook` will be treated as a different one from `./Programming/Python/PythonCookbook`.

### -t, --NotionToken

It is the secret token from Notion when an itegration is created. Visit [the official docs](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration) for further info. Don't forget to [give your integration page permissions](https://developers.notion.com/docs/create-a-notion-integration#give-your-integration-page-permissions).

### -d, --NotionDbId

The id of the Notion database where all info will be uploaded. This database has to exist in advance and the columns it needs to have are fixed and **can't be changed**. These are:

| Column Name | Type         |
|-------------|--------------|
| File Name   | Title        |
| Title       | Text         |
| Priority    | Select       |
| Status      | Select       |
| Format      | Multi-select |
| Tags        | Multi-select |
| Comments    | Text         |
| Author      | Text         |
| Publisher   | Text         |
| ISBN        | Text         |

To get the database ID value, open the database as a full page in Notion. Use the Share menu to Copy link. Now paste the link in your text editor so you can take a closer look. The URL uses the following format:

```plain
https://www.notion.so/{workspace_name}/{database_id}?v={view_id}
```

### -f, --Formats

These are the formats that will be taken into account. At this moment, **.epub, .pdf and .paper** are supported and used by default.
```plain
library2notion -f EPUB PAPER  -> only look for .epub and .paper files
library2notion -f PDF         -> only look for .pdf files
```

## Metadata

The tool will extract the following data to upload to Notion:

- **File Name**: is the full path to the file. It is used as primary key of the table in Notion, so it can't be duplicated.
- **Title**: title of the book.
- **Tags**: the categories of the book. They are generated automatically from the path. For example, if the path is `./Tech Books/Programming/Python/mybook.pdf`, the tags will be `Tech Books`, `Programming`, `Python`.
- **Author**: the author or authors of the book.
- **Publisher**: the publisher of the book.
- **Formats**: the available formats of the book. A book available in multiple formats will only appear once in the database.
- **ISBN**: the ISBN.

## Non-digital books (.paper)

With update 0.2.0, the tool supports non-digital books. You just have to create a `.paper` file in a folder per non-digital book that you want to add with the following content:

```json
{
    "Title": "",
    "Author": "",
    "Publisher": "",
    "ISBN": ""
}
```

## Log Files

A log file will be created after each execution in folder `./library2notion-logs`. It will include info about created, updated and deleted books.
